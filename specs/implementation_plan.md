- Implement handling of whitespace and comments

#### 1.3 Basic Cypher Parser - Syntax Analysis
- Create a parser for the MATCH clause
  - Parse node patterns `(variable:Label {properties})`

- Create a parser for basic WHERE conditions
  - Property comparisons (equals, not equals)
  - Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT)
  - Existence checks (EXISTS)
- Create a parser for basic CREATE/SET operations
  - Parse node creation
  - Parse relationship creation
  - Parse property setting

#### 1.4 Rule AST Generation
- Define AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) structure for rules
- Transform parsed Cypher into AST
- Implement validation of the AST
- Create visualization/debug tools for the AST (ASCII only)

- Add backtracking capability for failed matches

#### 2.4 Condition Evaluation
- Implement property access and comparison
- Implement boolean operators
- Implement existence checks
- Create a condition evaluation engine

### 3. Rule Application Engine (Phase 1)

#### 3.1 Action Execution
